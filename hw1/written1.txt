--2.1
	a) Convenience. An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.
	b) Efficiency.  An OS enables more efficient way to use the system resources.
	c) Ability to evolve.  An OS allows development and testing of new functions,
		while the existing services continue to work.

--2.2
	The kernel is the most heavily used part of the OS.  It runs the 
	supervisor mode and responds to calls from processes and interrupts.

	



2. 
	These instructions are called by the OS when it gives control 
	to a user
 program.  Therefore, they are usually privileged instructions.
	
	Applications trying to run these instructions are illegal, 
	
	and thus will raise a hardware exception.





3.
	
	The hardware will switch from user mode to supervisor mode, 
	and the OS 
will take control.  The OS has a function to handle interrupts.
