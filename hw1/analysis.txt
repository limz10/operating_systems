1.  
	The measured program is a pi calculator written in C. 
	It uses the Gregory formula to approximate the value of pi.
	It should be accurate to 8000 valid digits.

2.
	It measure wall-clock time, which is from the start to the end 
	of the whole program.
	User time, which is the time in user mode of the parent process
	System time, which is the time in kernel mode of the parent process
	Child user time, which is the time in user mode of the children process
	Child system time, which is the time in kernel mode of the parent process

3.
	Hereâ€™s some of my test results:
~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi

Real Time:		0.000557
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.000554
Child System TIme:	0.000000
~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi

Real Time:		0.000504
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.000501
Child System TIme:	0.000000
~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi

Real Time:		0.000511
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.000508
Child System TIme:	0.000000
~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi

Real Time:		0.000565
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.000562
Child System TIme:	0.000000



4.
	In order to make the numbers more non-trivial, I modified the 
	child process program to do even more computation and thus takes
	more time.  I have also tried other programs that take a lot of 
	time such as programs that encrypt files.

5.
	The parent process takes significantly smaller time than
	the child process, because the child process does comparatively
	significantly more computations.

6.
	The numbers shown from the test result clearly tells that they do not 
	sum to the total wall-clock time.

	That is probably because the wall-clock time record includes time taken
	by processes such as I/O and others.
