1.  
	The measured program is a pi calculator written in C. 
	It uses the Gregory formula to approximate the value of pi.
	It should be accurate to 8000 valid digits.
	The parent process will loop for 50 times.

2.
	It measure wall-clock time, which is from the start to the end 
	of the whole program.
	User time, which is the time in user mode of the parent process
	System time, which is the time in kernel mode of the parent process
	Child user time, which is the time in user mode of the children process
	Child system time, which is the time in kernel mode of the 
	parent process

	Hereâ€™s some of my test results:
~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi
Real Time:		0.002350
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.002333
Child System Time:	0.000002

~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi
Real Time:		0.002752
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.002741
Child System Time:	0.000001

~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi
Real Time:		0.002396

~/Desktop/comp111/hw1 > ./timing pi
Real Time:		0.002430
User Time:		0.000000
System Time:		0.000000
Child User Time:	0.002418
Child System Time:	0.000003


4.
	In order to make the numbers more non-trivial, I modified the 
	child process program to do even more computation and thus takes
	more time.  What is more, the parent process is looped for 50 times.
	I have also tried other programs that take a lot of 
	time such as programs that encrypt files, in order to ensure that 
	the test results show the correct pattern.

5.
	The parent process takes significantly smaller time than
	the child process, because the child process does comparatively
	significantly more computations.

6.
	The numbers shown from the test result clearly tells that they do not 
	sum to the total wall-clock time.

	That is probably because the wall-clock time record includes time taken
	by processes such as I/O and others.
