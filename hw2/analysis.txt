This program compares system call getpid() with other
function calls in C.  The result shows that system calls
take longer time than procedure calls.

The system calls are expected to be more expensive than 
procedure calls, because a single system call involves many
actions that are not happening during a procedure call.
For instance, there must be a space switch as the system calls
run in the kernel space.  The kernel will verify that the 
arguments are legal.  Such services yields more overhead time
of a system call, while a function call is only in user space
and less overhead time.

One of the benefit of C libraries is that some common
instructions such as fopen are wrapped within the 
C runtime library.  This enables the code to run much faster.

In this assigned program, it compares system call getpid()
and other functions.  Return_10 only returns a value of 10.
The PowerOfTen calls the pow() function in the math.h and 
calculates the exponential value of numbers.  Because of the
mode switching, getpid() will take much longer than the others.

Here's some of the test results:

~/Desktop/comp111/hw2 > ./sysproc
Avg Time for System Calls: 11.898000
Avg Time for Return_10 Calls: 6.775000
Avg Time for Power10 Calls: 5.953000

~/Desktop/comp111/hw2 > ./sysproc
Avg Time for System Calls: 11.822000
Avg Time for Return_10 Calls: 6.780000
Avg Time for Power10 Calls: 5.948000

~/Desktop/comp111/hw2 > ./sysproc
Avg Time for System Calls: 11.822000
Avg Time for Return_10 Calls: 6.806000
Avg Time for Power10 Calls: 5.952000

~/Desktop/comp111/hw2 > ./sysproc
Avg Time for System Calls: 11.838000
Avg Time for Return_10 Calls: 6.772000
Avg Time for Power10 Calls: 5.938000

~/Desktop/comp111/hw2 > ./sysproc
Avg Time for System Calls: 11.854000
Avg Time for Return_10 Calls: 6.794000
Avg Time for Power10 Calls: 5.926000


I also experimented to compare with more complex functions
in C.  Those functions include multiple loops and calculations,
and surely more time overhead. The result is in line with the theory.
