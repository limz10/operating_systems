1. 
	fork() can return errors.  From the linux manual on fork()
	Return Value
		On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, 
		and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the 
		parent, no child process is created, and errno is set appropriately.
	
	Errors
		EAGAIN
		    fork() cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy the parent's 
		    page tables and allocate a task structure for the child. 
		EAGAIN
		    It was not possible to create a new process because the caller's 
		    RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit was encountered. To exceed this limit, 
		    the process must have either the CAP_SYS_ADMIN or the 
		    CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability. 
		ENOMEM
		    fork() failed to allocate the necessary kernel structures 
		    because memory is tight. 
		ENOSYS
		    fork() is not supported on this platform (for example, 
		    hardware without a Memory-Management Unit).


2.
	The process is sent to blocked from running state whenever it is 
	waiting for an event.  The processes in ready state are to be chosen
	by the processor to execute.  Therefore, there is really no way a 
	process in ready state would skip the running state and enter blocked 
	state directly.
