Description
    
    This manual outlines all the commands that this shell supports and its 
    usages.

Usage

Here are the following commands supported by the shell, along with their 
invocation and usage.

        cd <directory> : This command changes the current directory to the one 
        specified in the <directory> argument. 

If no argument is present, it simply reports the current directory. Change  
the  current directory to directory.

        clr : Clears the screen

        dir <directory> : Lists the contents of the directory specified in the 
        <directory> argument.

            If no argument is present, it simply lists contents of the current 
            directory. 


        environ: Lists all the environment strings of the shell. 

        echo <comment> : Prints <comment> and then prints a newline at the end.

        help : Invoke this user manual

        pause  : Pauses operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.

        quit : Waits for all child processes to finish and then exits the 
        shell. Users may also use 'Control-D' to end their current session. 


All other command line inputs are interpreted as program invocation.

    Usage examples:

        ./<exec> to run executable in local directory or

        path/to/exec to run executable to any arbitrary executable path

The shell also supports I/O redirection with the use of the '>' and the '>>' 
commands. '>' creates/overwrites an existing file, and '>>' tries to append to 
an existing file if present, or creates and writes into a new file.


Background process for the specific command are enabled if '&' is appended at 
the end of a command. If the commands are separated with a ';', the processes 
are ran concurrently before returning to the user.
